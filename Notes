Spoor is a possible rewrite of microbe.

The idea with both is to provide a personal microblogging space for
all kinds of small / microformattable data, that can then be
(optionally) syndicated to various other endpoints, whether public
or private.  Example data might include conventional microblogging
(tweets, dents, posts, etc.), plus bookmarks, wishlist items, photos,
reading lists, todos, etc.

Tags can be used to carve out personal namespaces, which can then
syndicated to other endpoints with adaptors, if desired.

Questions:
- is it worth rewriting under the microbe name, or should we rename?
- how can it be simpler?
- is spoor a useful moniker?
- is sqlite the right data store?
- for things like wishlists, book lists, todos, etc. you might want
  different/customised web interfaces


On the simpler front: how about a blosxom-like text-file based scheme,
named by date, perhaps grouped by month e.g. posts/201107/20110718T173146.12
