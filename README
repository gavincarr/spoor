Introduction
------------

Spoor is a micro-blogging micro-app for personal use. It provides a
simple twitter-like post api, and a lightweight web interface,
including feeds support. You'd typically run it on some server you
control - no root access is required, and all posts go into a sqlite
database.

Spoor is intended as a personal micro-blogging hub - you post most/all
of your stuff to it, some of which is intended only for particular
audiences, and some of which may be private. Spoor then forwards posts
out to (multiple) endpoints, depending on how posts are hash-tagged.

For instance, my standard configuration is to forward all my posts to
identi.ca and twitter by default, and to forward to by bookmarking
services (delicious and pinboard) if I add a #bm hashtag. Posts tagged
#pri are private and don't get forwarded anywhere. There are also #i
and #t tags if I want to limit a post to identi.ca or twitter,
respectively.
