Spoor Installation
==================

These instructions are developed on Linux, but should work on any Unix-like
environment, including Mac OSX, with minor modifications.


1. Unpack the spoor tarball somewhere e.g. your home directory.
   Or if you like the bleeding edge, clone from github:
   
      git clone https://github.com/gavincarr/spoor


2. Make sure the following perl modules are installed. Note that Mojolicious
   >= 1.99 requires perl >= 5.10.1, so if you're running an older perl (debian,
   CentOS 5, etc.), you may want to install an older Mojolicious (e.g. 1.90).

      Encode >= 2.43
      Mojolicious
      Mojolicious::Plugin::BasicAuth
      DBD::SQLite
      Exporter::Lite
      Config::Tiny
      HTML::Entities
      Lingua::EN::Inflect
      LWP
      LWP::Protocol::https
      Regexp::Common::microsyntax
      Time::Piece
      XML::Atom
      YAML
      Net::Twitter          (if you want to forward to twitter/identi.ca)
      Net::Delicious        (if you want to forward to delicious/pinboard)


[ If you don't have root access, use cpanminus (http://cpanmin.us/), which
  will install them to ~/perl5, and then add PERL5LIB=/home/user/perl5 to your
  environment. ]



3. Setup an empty database and a local spoor.conf: 

      cp var/spoor.db.dist var/spoor.db
      cp conf/spoor.conf.dist conf/spoor.conf
      $EDITOR conf/spoor.conf


4. Startup the spoor web service:

      ./spoor daemon --mode production --listen http://*:3007

You should now be able connect to http://localhost:3007/, login, and create
posts.



5. If you want to forward to other services (twitter, delicious etc.), then
configure forwarder.conf appropriately:

      cp conf/forwarder.conf.dist conf/forwarder.conf
      $EDITOR conf/forwarder.conf

You can test forwarding by hand:

      # Dry run
      bin/forwarder -v --noop --target identica
      # Forward 1st post only
      bin/forwarder -v --count 1 --target identica

Once everything is working, you can add the desired entries from
conf/forwarder.crontab.dist to your personal crontab:

      cat conf/forwarder.crontab.dist
      crontab -e



6. If you're running spoor on a laptop or behind a firewall you're all done.
If you want to run on the internet, you should run behind an SSL-capable proxy
of some kind. I use nginx - see conf/nginx.conf.dist for a starting point for a
config.
